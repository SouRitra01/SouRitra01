## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m an **Applied Data Scientist** with deep experience at the intersection of **Machine Learning, MLOps, and large-scale operational systems**.

I specialize in turning research-grade models into **production-ready ML systems** that deliver measurable business impact — especially in **forecasting, anomaly detection, and decision automation**.

- 5+ years across Applied ML, Data Science, and Operations Research  
- Strong focus on **model reliability, latency, monitoring, and trust**  
- Experienced in owning models **end-to-end**: problem → deployment → adoption

## 🧠 Key Technical Achievements

### 📈 ML Forecasting Systems
Prophet + XGBoost ensemble predicting global demand across **10+ regions**, achieving **3.1% MAPE** and improving planning accuracy at scale.

### 🤖 LLM-based Anomaly Detection
LangChain + OpenAI pipelines processing **50+ daily operational signals**, reducing investigation time by **60%** via automated root-cause summaries.

### ⚙️ MLOps Automation
Designed **SageMaker-based pipelines** with automated retraining, monitoring, rollback, and deployment for **8+ production models**.

### 🔬 Transformer Research
BERT / RoBERTa experimentation improving **NLP recall by 28%**, focused on real-world signal extraction and ranking tasks.
